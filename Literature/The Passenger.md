## Comparison with other works of McCarthy

### Far less Violence
But the voilence


## Background

### Historical Context: The Aftermath of the Atomic Age and the Rise of Quantum Physics
In classical mechanics, objects exist in a specific place at a specific [time](https://www.livescience.com/what-is-time). In quantum mechanics, objects instead exist in a haze of probabilityA deeper understanding of quantum mechanics, specifically by eminent 1920s scientist Neils Bohr, ultimately led to the development of the atomic bomb, which changed the course of human history. That humanity possesses means to exterminate itself from the planet is a central theme in the novel.

### Authorial Context: Cormac McCarthy’s Literary Eras
For those new to McCarthy’s work, it is best to see _The Passenger_ as a departure from earlier works. These earlier works can generally be categorized by geography: the mid-south or The west of the United States. It's similar to The Road publicated in 2006, McCarthy once again began shifting into new spaces and new thematic concerns. That novel imagines a post-apocalyptic world and those who survive a global catastrophe, often assumed to be a nuclear war.

There are also many other literary challenge of McCarthy from this work. While McCarthy's work has included a number of unconventional themes, such as serial murder and incest, he has been criticized for being conservative in many ways when it comes to the nature of his characters. Most of his protagonists have been straight, white males. However, in both *The Passenger* and *Stella Maris*, McCarthy featured the transgender Debussy as a major character, and he wrote a female protagonist, Alicia Western, who he said “I was planning on writing about a woman for 50 years.” 

# Themes
## Systematic and Thematic binarity
“Without malefactors the world of the righteous is robbed of all meaning.”﻿
([Chapter 5](https://www.supersummary.com/the-passenger/chapters-5-6-summary/#426603), Page 141)_John Sheddan’s comment_ It also appears McCarthy's works structures: Postmodern catholic, Romantic naturalism and so on

### What gives life meaning?
Granellen(old woman) says to him, “You have to believe that there is good in the world. I’m goin to say that you have to believe that the work of your hands will bring it into your life. You may be wrong but if you dont believe that then you will not have a life” (173). Granellen uses the imperative here, suggesting that finding meaning in life comes through conscious, deliberate, ongoing action rather than being the result of any mathematical or scientific calculation
<- Against the backdrop of the universe’s apparent indifference and meaninglessness, Bobby cannot see the simple fact that he can make his own reality as Granellen suggests.

### The meaninglessness of life among the nature
Significantly, for his acquaintances, the ego is a diminished thing in light of a belief in God or some other Higher Power, and it needs to be in order to make sense of human existence. At the beginning of Chapter 5, The Kid says to Alicia, “You will never know what the world is made of. The only thing that’s certain is that it’s not made of the world,” followed by the harsh truth that “The world will take your life. But above all and lastly the world does not know that you are here” (127). The Kid frequently points out to Alicia the indifference of the universe.

“He stopped to look back at his bare footprints. Filling with water one by one.” 
(Chapter 7, Page 270) Bobby’s footprints on the sand are filled in with water
## When literary naturalism goes to Posthumanism
Humanity’s insistence on bringing order to the chaos that is the universe is ultimately a futile exercise, a grasping for permanence in the face of indifference. When The Kid says, “You cant get hold of the world. You can only draw a picture. Whether it’s a bull on the wall of a cave or a partial differential equation it’s all the same thing” (279), he’s describing the absurdity of trying to find meaning in an indifferent universe.

## Nonhuman, objective forces that affect humans
#### Time
Ch3. “The weight of it moving over him. Endlessly, endlessly. In a sense of the relentless passing of time like nothing else.” current~time_The narrator describes Bobby’s first dive in the Mississippi River._

### Capitalism
“The time would come when all memory of this place and these people would be stricken from the register of the world.”([Chapter 5](https://www.supersummary.com/the-passenger/chapters-5-6-summary/#426603), Page 177)The narrator expresses impoverished people living in Appalachia. They will simply cease to exist even in history_

## 'The Passenger'

She touched his cheek. I dont have to.
You dont know how it will end.
I dont care how it will end. I only care about now.
In the spring of the year birds began to arrive on the beach from across the gulf. Weary passerines. Vireos. Kingbirds and grosbeaks. Too exhausted to move. You could pick them up out of the sand and hold them trembling in your palm. Their small hearts beating and their eyes shuttering. He walked the beach with his flashlight the whole of the night to fend away predators and toward the dawn he slept with them in the sand. That none disturb these **passengers**(283).
- All living things are passengers through time and space, riding at the same speed toward the same end.

# Characters

## Bobby Western
- 과거에 대한 집착: 직업이 구조 다이버로, 소설에서 중요한 [은유](https://www.supersummary.com/metaphor/) 입니다 . Bobby는 균형 잡힌 삶을 유지하기 위해 고군분투하며 종종 개인적인 삶의 "잔해"를 구조합니다. 그는 과거를 되살리는 데 많은 시간을 보내며, 특히 여동생 Alicia의 자살에 대한 후회
- 무목적성과 신에 대한 의심: Alicia만큼 지적으로 재능 있는 사람이 삶을 계속 살아가는 것을 이해할 수 없다는 생각에 사로잡히고, 이 사실이 그의 전반적인 무목적성의 원인
  "Bobby is positioned somewhere between belief and disbelief. His friend Debussy says to him, “I know you don’t believe in God. But you don’t even believe that there is a structure to the world. To a person’s life,” to which Bobby replies, “It’s just a dream” (103). For her part, Debussy insists that “it’s not just that” (103)."

- 자연과 과학에 대한 관심: 어렸을 때 할머니 집 근처의 연못 서식지에 존재하는 모든 생명체에 라벨을 붙이고 분류할 수 있었다. 젊은 시절 바비의 목적은 과학적 탐구를 통해 세상을 이해하는 것이다. 이것들은 바비가 혼란스러운 삶에서 질서를 찾으려는 수단이었으나 알리시아의 죽음 이후 모든 의욕이 꺾이게 된다. 
“The reason we cant fully grasp the quantum world is because we didnt evolve in that world. But the real mystery is the one that plagued Darwin. How can we come to know difficult things that have no survival value” (146). - contemplating Naturalistic Darwinism in contemporary point of view

## Alicia Western
- 인간의 지식의 허무함: 작품은 알리시아의 자살과 함께 시작된다. 그녀는 자신을 "깨진" 사람으로 여기며 신에 대해 끊임없이 의심합니다. "(God) is not interested in our theology but only in our silence” (116)  존 셰던이 "슬픔이 없는 삶은 전혀 삶이 아니다"라고 [주장한 것을](https://www.supersummary.com/claim/) 정확하게 보여줍니다 (14). 그녀의 삶은 때때로 바비에 대한 사랑으로만 해소되는 끊임없는 고뇌입니다.
- a philosophical tangent about the nature of lines, that all lines are broken, and that one cannot retrace a line to its origin without losing where they are.

### The Thalidomide Kid
- 알리시아의 심리적 방어기제: The Kid is a hallucination, it is Alicia’s interior monologue, which reveals the depths of her emotional suffering and she is trying to escape from. But, ironically, The Kid appears to be trying to persuade Alicia out of dying by suicide.
- 과학적 문제: a man who has what the narrator refers to as “flippers” instead of hands. Thalidomide was a medicine originally used to treat symptoms of morning sickness. The fetuses of pregnant women who took the medication were often affected in their physical development. The Kid’s name symbolizes how scientific interventions can lead to unintended consequences, a theme taken up in a much larger scope later in the novel as characters discuss and reflect on discoveries in physics that led to the development of the atomic bomb.

Kid: because of the nature of time, and human understanding of it, a moment in time is just that. Once it is lived, it is gone from our objective experience. It vanishes into the world of human memory. = 이전에 인간의 언어로 인해 불가능해지는 자연에 대한 이해
(알리시아가)“She knew that in the end you really cant know. You cant get hold of the world. You can only draw a picture. Whether it’s a bull on the wall of a cave or a partial differential equation it’s all the same thing” (279)

### Alicia
Her primary problem(the reason why she killed herself) was one of disbelief and the inability to accept it. He says, “no matter the magnitude of your doubts about the nature of the world you cant come up with another world without coming up with another you” (280). The novel posits that there is no alternative to the world we are born into, and that there is no possibility of escaping to some other level of existence. She was not able to make Søren Kierkegaard’s leap of faith; hence, she was consumed by despair.
In some ways, Bobby’s and Alicia’s self-destructive tendencies are a microcosm of humanity’s self-destructive tendencies as represented by the atomic bomb.

**John Sheddan**: existentialist or Buddhist “Suffering is a part of the human condition and must be borne. But misery is a choice” (347). Suffering, according to John, is the result of having the awareness that we are on the train and that it is taking us to the destination whether we like it or not. John also expresses a sentiment similar to what The Kid claims Alicia felt, saying, “I have never understood in the slightest why I was here” (347)

ch10. Human consciousness can be seen as the light that continues even though our bodies, as material objects, do not. Also significant is that John purposely seeks out the theater for the same reason: that it can never be dark. He finds comfort in that eternal light, which contrasts with the return to womb-like darkness that Miss Vivian suggests in the previous chapter.

**Debussy Fields**:  Inductive beliefs for living well
Ch2. “I dont know who God is or what he is. But I dont believe all this stuff got here by itself. Including me. Maybe everything evolves just like they say it does. But if you sound it to its source you have to come ultimately to an intention.”

## Miss Vivian
The philosophy of Suffering. In this she seems to say humans do not bring despair with them into the world; instead, an indifferent universe imposes upon humans the conditions from which despair emerges.

### Granellen
“You have to believe that there is good in the world. I’m goin to say that you have to believe that the work of your hands will bring it into your life.”([Chapter 5](https://www.supersummary.com/the-passenger/chapters-5-6-summary/#426603), Page 173)

 "I believe in God’s design. I’ve had dark hours and I’ve had dark doubts in those hours."

## The positive side of determinism?
The goal of nature is positive not only for nature itself, but also for human who determinate themselves by nuclear and contemination.
