Alicia Western
Alicia attributes her profound spiritual and psychological turmoil to being brought up in a location associated with momentous death and destruction.

> If I had any fear of the eidolons, it was not their being or their appearance but what they had in mind. That’s what I had no understanding of. The only thing I actually understood about them was that they were trying to put a shape and a name to that which had none (22).

  

This communicative role aligns with Alicia’s theory of the unconscious, which she regards as a prelingual means of communication between brain and body. For Alicia, the unconscious communicates what cannot be expressed in words—a theory McCarthy himself articulates in his essay “The Kekulé Problem.”

  

Alicia perceives her mind as undergoing entropy, characterizing herself as “decaying.” She asserts that the world lacks inherent meaning or purpose, adopting an atheistic stance and dismissing spiritual explanations, arguing that “the notion that everything is just stuff doesn’t seem to do it for us” (36). However, she distances herself from materialism as well, rejecting any comprehensive explanation of the world and denying that reality can exist outside of human perception.

Alicia describes an era of darkness and meaninglessness, asserting that everything changed with the advent of humanity: “all of this until the first living creature possessed of vision agreed to imprint the universe upon its primitive and trembling sensorium and then to touch it with color and movement and memory” (40).

 She points to numbers as a prime example of this phenomenon, being invented quantities. This realization prompts Alicia to renounce mathematics as a false source of truth.

## Theme
### Archatron
"When did you first think that suicide might be an option for you?"

"I saw through something like a judas hole into this world where there were sentinels standing at a gate and I knew that beyond the gate was something terrible and that it had power over me."
"A being. A presence. And that the search for shelter and for a covenant among us was simply to elude this baleful thing of which we were in endless fear and yet of which we had no knowledge."
"" I called it the Archatron.
The presence beyond the gate.
The presence beyond the gate."
I wish it were a dream and I could wake. I wish I could forget it but I cant. I wish I could be who I was before but I never will be.


 how else would you discuss them? But when the subject is chimeras arent you already on somewhat shaky ground? I’ve thought from early on that the Kid was there not to supply something but to keep something at bay. 
You’d be loath to grant these beings a will of their own, but if they were not possessed of something like **autonomy** in what sense could they then be said to exist? I’ve no power either to conjure them forth or send them packing. ... I said that they were indistinguishable from living beings, but the truth is that their reality is if anything more striking. 

What is it that he’s keeping at bay?
The Kid?
The Kid.
I dont think there’s a simple answer to that. If the world itself is a horror then there is nothing to fix and the only thing you could be protected from would be the contemplation of it.

### The nature of the unconscious~The Kekulé problem
Alicia characterizes the unconscious not as a supernatural or magical entity, as commonly imagined, but rather as purely biological—“machine for operating an animal” (129). 

Alicia rejects the notion of a cohesive, singular self, dismissing it as an [illusion](https://www.supersummary.com/illusion/). Instead, she envisions multiple, conflicting selves, mirroring her fragmented hallucinations that contend and interact with each other. This multiplicity reflects the inherent randomness of the world, where each facet remains unaware of how they function, as understanding would jeopardize the integrity of the entire system.


"But what he had just understood is that one thing can be another thing. Not look like it or act upon it. Be it. Stand for it."
#### Dream
"꿈은 우리를 깨워 기억하라고 말해줍니다. 어쩌면 할 일이 없을 수도 있습니다. 어쩌면 질문은 공포가 세상에 대한 경고인지, 아니면 우리 자신에 대한 경고인지일 수도 있습니다."
  
### Suicide
Alicia persistently contends that mathematical knowledge is inherently abstract. She asserts that the genesis of modern civilization occurred when an ancient individual discovered the concept that “one thing can be another thing” (134). This profound realization paved the way for the development of art, mathematics, language, and numerous other inventions that shape human life, society, and culture. 

Ironically, it is this very knowledge that prompts Alicia to seriously contemplate death by suicide.

“the first rule of the world is that everything vanishes forever” (171)

### Math
- topos theory: unsuccessful obsession with uncovering evidence of the existence of material reality independent of human perception.

- intelligent comprehension constitutes the sole purpose of life, a goal achievable, in her view, only through the framework of mathematics.

- but Alicia articulates her disenchantment with mathematics, asserting that it has shifted from a tool for comprehending the world to a system of abstract operators and descriptors devoid of relevance to the true essence of existence._

### Determinism, level of human/nonhuman
Human level_optimism in which it was widely believed that mathematics would soon comprehend the universe in its totality.
“you can’t mathematize mathematics” (88)

Mathematics, she contends, exists independently of the workings of the human mind.

in opposition to Platonism, rejecting the notion of universality, transcendence, and existence beyond material reality of mathematical concepts. Gödel shared her belief that mathematical abstractions had a true existence surpassing the limitations of the material world. Instead, she says, “Mathematics is ultimately a faith-based initiative. And faith is an uncertain business” (66).

[subjective](https://www.supersummary.com/subjective/) idealism, rooted in solipsism, asserts that only the mind is certain to exist, encompassing thoughts, experiences, affects, etc.

With increasing desperation, Alicia seeks quantifiable truths through mathematical topos theory—the study of the behavior of geometric objects


Alicia’s love for Bobby, along with her inability or unwillingness to accept the societal restrictions that prevent their union, is closely tied to the theme of **The [Subjective](https://www.supersummary.com/subjective/) Nature of Reality**.


##### Level of nonhuman
definitive about the world in a single sentence:
“The world has created no living thing that it does not intend to destroy.”

If the world has a mind then it’s all worse than we thought.

### Solipsism

. All of this until the first living creature possessed of vision agreed to imprint the universe upon its primitive and trembling sensorium and then to touch it with color and movement and memory. It made of me an overnight solipsist and to some extent I am yet.”
_세상이 형성되기 전의 공허 속에는 실체적 현실이 없었습니다. 그러나 인류가 등장하면서 인간의 감각은 세상에 지울 수 없는 각인을 남기기 시작했습니다. 이러한 이해는 조지 버클리의 "시각에 대한 새로운 이론을 향한 에세이"_


### What is the relationship determinism with solipsism?

human consciousness and reality are not the same thing.”

([Part 1, Chapter 2](https://www.supersummary.com/stella-maris/part-1-chapters-1-3-summary/#545958), Page 45)
_명목상(Nominal)의 세계와 현상상의 세계 사이에 진정한 구별이 없다_

other words, nothing can be excerpted from the absolute without being rendered perceptual. Bearing in mind that to claim reality for what is unknowable is already to speak in tongues.

## Ethics
“There has never been a century so grim as this one. Does anyone seriously think that we’ve seen the last of its like? And yet what can the world’s troubles mean to someone unable to shoulder her own?”
