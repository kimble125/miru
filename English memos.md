**Letter to Amazon**
Dear Amazon IR agents.  

Hello, my name is Harris and I'm studying data analytics at an academy in South Korea.

I am focusing on data analysis for commerce, and I think Amazon is a company that commerce companies around the world should look up to. 

I am particularly impressed that Amazon went through a significant crisis in 2020 when the pandemic hit and later in 2022, but they overcame it well and are still doing quite well in terms of sales, market share, and net profit. Now that the global economy is in a downward spiral again, I think commerce companies should learn from Amazon's wisdom in overcoming the crisis, and it is beneficial for data analysts to gain insights into Amazon's strategies during that time. 

  

However, I've found it difficult to find reliable CSVs of Amazon's transactional data (purchase history, order frequency, etc.), customer data (purchases by customer, app interaction patterns, feedback, and inquiries), and product data (description, category, price, image data) from around 2020 to the present on Keggle and elsewhere. Do you know if AboutAmazon, the site that publicly communicates Amazon's position and data, has such data and would be willing to make it available to analysts like us, or do you know where we can find it? 

Please let me know if you have any information about them. 

  

My best,

Harris
